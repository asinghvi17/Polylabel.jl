It returns a 2-Tuple of floats, representing the x and y  coordinates of the pole of inaccessibility that was computed.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Polylabel.Cell","page":"Home","title":"Polylabel.Cell","text":"Cell(x, y, half_size, polygon)\n\nComparison operators operate on the max_distance field.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Polylabel.polylabel-Tuple{Any}","page":"Home","title":"Polylabel.polylabel","text":"polylabel(polygon::Polygon; tolerance = 1.0)\npolylabel(multipoly::MultiPolygon; tolerance = 1.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
